SEMIPRIME:A semiprime number is an integer which can be expressed as a product of two distinct primes. For example 15 = 3*5 is a semiprime number but 9 = 3*3 is not .
Given an integer number N, find whether it can be expressed as a sum of two semi-primes or not (not necessarily distinct).
ex:Input:30
   Output:Yes
